# Introduction

## Major Life Events

I was born just a few hours north of URI, in Framingham, Mass. Because of my dad's work in the Air Force, I've taken a long and complex route to get back to the east coast. After a few years in Massachussets, we moved to Ohio until I was 7, when we moved to England!

Growing up partially in England was a lot of fun and sparked an early interest in international travel. We spent a few months at Mildenhall Air Force base and the rest of the time in the countryside.

**My family has lived in Utah since our time in England.**

**I did a church service mission to western Canada for two years which was a lot of fun, except in the winters.**

**I moved to URI to study Environmental Science, a topic that piqued my interest during my undergraduate degree at Brigham Young University.**

# Hobbies

## Photography

Photography has been a love of mine for over a decade. I started strong when I was 12 and haven't slowed down since then. I primarily do landscape photography, but also enjoy portraits, macro, and long exposure.

## Singing

I began singing in senior year of high school when some friends from the choir (almost literally) dragged me to auditions. I had a blast in high school so I sang in the advanced men's chorus in my undergraduate.

Here's a music video we filmed:

## Playing with all animals I come in contact with

I love animals, and relish all opportunities I get to hang out with them. I feel very lucky that my roommate has a very cute cat (pictured below).
