# Introduction
**A simple introduction for an incredibly complex human**

I was born just a few hours north of URI, in Framingham, Mass. Because of my dad's work in the Air Force, I've taken a long and complex route to get back to the east coast. After a few years in Massachussets, we moved to Ohio until I was 7, when we moved to England!
